# Unseen extension for Firefox

![Screenshot of Facebook's 'seen' status](http://i45.tinypic.com/2yv44r7.png)

Facebook has a new feature where the other party is notified once you read their message. Sometimes you may not want this for privacy reasons.

This extension simply blocks sending your 'seen' status from being sent to the other party.

Bug reports can be sent to tangrs at tangrs.id.au
